Alternatives
============

Several other packages might be better suited to your particular needs. Here
are some to consider, along with some notes. It is believed that none of
these other packages allow to automatically switch outputs between unit
systems with a single command.

* numericalunits: Units are values. Simple.
* astropy.units: Great, but locks units into calculation values - can't get
  back to simple floats or arrays.
* sympy.physics.units: Solid.
* pint: A very powerful units package.
* unyt: An excellent and capable package.
* quantiphy: Seems a bit awkward to use.
* Buckingham: A bit awkward to use.
* DimPy: Very old.
* Magnitude: Clunky to use.
* Python-quantities: A good package.
* physipy: Another good package
* SciMath Units: Large range of units.
* cf_units: Suggested replacement of old udunitspy package. Clunky.
* Units
* Unum
* quantities
* physical-quantities
* parampy
* pynbody
* misu
* pysics
